Patient Zero Simulation


This archive contains all necessary files to reproduce the figures from our submission "Inference of a Rumor's Source in the Independent Cascade Model". It uses the GNU parallel tool to speed up the simulation by parallelizing suitable tasks, see https://www.gnu.org/software/parallel/.

To generate the figures, use the "make-plots" script:

$ ./make-plots

This will generate random networks, simulate the forward and reconstruction processes, gather the relevant data, plot everything, and create a one-page pdf file (simple.pdf) containing the plots.
